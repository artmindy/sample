                <p>I’m Peri, a user-experience and user-interface designer interested in creating digital products. I’ve over 10 years of experience working in the field of information system development - initially in business and system analysis; working on projects ranging from primary research, feasibility study, development of Terms of Reference, mockups of user-interfaces and conducting users testings.</p>
                <p>The  creation of design systems, as the intersection between research, technical approach, user-experience and visual design is a main focus for me now. UX and UI Design allows me to apply my experience in the research and analysis sphere with proper visualization of all ideas and solutions, so the interested parties can see, understand and give feedback on the usefulness of the solutions.</p>
                <p>I am self-studying the basis of UX and UI design (from the books and different online courses). I hold a Bachelor of Automatization and Management from the Kazakh-British Technical University and a Master Degree in International Technology Management from Warwick University in the United Kingdom. Outside of design I'm an amateur swimmer in a pool, loves the art and learning language. I live in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, with my husband and three years daughter.</p>
